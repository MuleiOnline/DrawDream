1. I awoke with a start, the heat pressing against my skin and the room awash in a blinding brightness that made my eyes water as I struggled to acclimate.
2. Despite the oppressive heat, I could see snowflakes falling outside through a grand window, the flurries dancing incongruently in the sun-drenched, gothic chamber.
3. The room, adorned with antique furnishings and heavy velvet drapes, projected a sense of long-forgotten luxury that now felt eerie and unwelcoming.
4. A shiver ran down my spine, not from the cold but from the unmistakable sensation of unseen eyes intently fixed upon me, leaving my heart pounding in my chest.
5. As I scrambled to my feet, the heavy wooden door creaked ominously, inching open as if guided by an invisible hand, amplifying my fear.
6. I stood frozen, squinting through the light, bracing myself for what was to come, as a shadowy figure began to emerge from the threshold of the doorway.
